# Funnel

A *Funnel* is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.

Example: 
    * Answering each part of a 5 question survey on customer satisfaction.
    * Clicking "Continue" on each step of a set of 5 onboarding modals.
    * Browsing a selection of products -> Viewing a shopping cart -> Making a purhcase.

Generally, we want to know the total number of users in each stage of the funnel, as well as the percent of users who complete each stage.

Let's use real data to understand concept of Funnel.
